# CodingChallenge
 Tracking my coding journey: Created a repository to log progress. Goal: solve 2 problems daily. Improving skills, problem-solving abilities, and knowledge. Organizing solutions by topics and difficulty levels. Reflecting on challenges overcome. Consistent practice for mastery. Excited for growth and community engagement.
